# google_test_app

This app follows along Googles tutorial for the intro to Flutter. The
design of the app is an infite list generted of startup names that you
can favourite and view in another window. 

Since this was a just to start understanding Flutter and the basics I ended
it at the finished product shown below. This mini project gave me an idea of 
how containers work as well as how flutter it self functions. There is still
a lot to learn but hopefully I can expand on this knowledge some more in my 
next projects.
